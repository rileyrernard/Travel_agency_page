Project #3: Enhancing SEO with Meta Descriptions & Image Links
This third web development project focuses on two key areas. First, I've incorporated meta descriptions to improve SEO, a process I'm learning will help with search engine visibility.

Second, I've practiced adding links to images and configured them to open in a new tab when clicked.

While the website remains simple, I'm confident that my skills will continue to grow, allowing me to build more complex and dynamic projects in the future.
